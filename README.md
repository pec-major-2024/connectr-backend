## Algorithm for Matching Nodes with Weighted Cosine Similarity

This algorithm utilizes weighted cosine similarity to match nodes based on their emotional states and keywords. Cosine similarity measures the directional similarity between two vectors, making it suitable for comparing entities with multi-dimensional emotional profiles. Here's the breakdown:

**1. Preprocessing:**

* **Normalize Emotion Scores:** Since emotions are represented as numerical values (anger, disgust, etc.), normalize them to a range of 0 to 1 using techniques like min-max scaling. This ensures all emotions contribute equally to the similarity score.
* **Tokenize Keywords:** Split the keywords list in each node into individual tokens. This allows for keyword matching between nodes.

**2. Weighted Cosine Similarity:**

* Define two weight factors:
    * `emotion_weight` (higher weight): This reflects the greater importance of emotional compatibility.
    * `keyword_weight` (lower weight): This accounts for keyword overlap.
* Calculate the cosine similarity between the normalized emotion vectors (`emotion_vec_a` and `emotion_vec_b`) of two nodes (`node_a` and `node_b`).

```python
def cosine_similarity(emotion_vec_a, emotion_vec_b):
  # Calculate dot product and magnitude of vectors
  dot_product = np.dot(emotion_vec_a, emotion_vec_b)
  magnitude_a = np.linalg.norm(emotion_vec_a)
  magnitude_b = np.linalg.norm(emotion_vec_b)
  # Handle potential division by zero
  if magnitude_a * magnitude_b == 0:
    return 0
  return dot_product / (magnitude_a * magnitude_b)
```

* Calculate the Jaccard similarity between the keyword sets (`keyword_set_a` and `keyword_set_b`) of the nodes. This measures the overlap between the sets.

```python
def jaccard_similarity(keyword_set_a, keyword_set_b):
  intersection = len(keyword_set_a.intersection(keyword_set_b))
  union = len(keyword_set_a.union(keyword_set_b))
  if union == 0:
    return 0
  return intersection / union
```

* Combine the similarities using weighted summation:

```python
def weighted_similarity(node_a, node_b):
  emotion_similarity = cosine_similarity(node_a['emotion'], node_b['emotion'])
  keyword_similarity = jaccard_similarity(node_a['keywords'], node_b['keywords'])
  return emotion_weight * emotion_similarity + keyword_weight * keyword_similarity
```

**3. Matching and Threshold:**

* Calculate the weighted similarity score for all unpaired nodes in the pool.
* Sort the node pairs by their similarity score in descending order.
* Iterate through the sorted list and mark a node pair as "suggested match" if their similarity score is above a predefined threshold. This threshold determines the minimum level of compatibility required for a suggestion.

**Why Cosine Similarity?**

Cosine similarity is chosen because it measures the direction and relative importance of features (emotions) in the vectors. It focuses on how closely the emotional profiles of two nodes align, even if the absolute values differ slightly. This makes it effective for matching nodes based on their emotional compatibility.

**Why Weighted Approach?**

The weighted approach assigns a higher weight to emotion matching compared to keyword matching. This prioritizes finding nodes with similar emotional states, reflecting the higher importance placed on emotional compatibility in your service.

**Accuracy Considerations:**

While cosine similarity provides a good measure of directional similarity, it's important to acknowledge limitations.

* **Limited Emotion Representation:**  The current schema uses single numerical values for each emotion. More nuanced representations like emotion intensity or valence (positive vs. negative) could improve accuracy.
* **Keyword Ambiguity:** Keyword overlap might not always imply semantic similarity. Techniques like stemming or lemmatization could enhance keyword matching.

**Additional Considerations:**

* Experiment with different weight values for emotions and keywords to find the optimal balance for your specific use case.
* Explore incorporating additional data points (e.g., user demographics) if relevant to refine the matching process.

By implementing this weighted cosine similarity approach, you can achieve a more accurate matching of nodes based on their emotional states and keywords, leading to better suggestions for your users.
